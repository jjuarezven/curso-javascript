        <p>
            <strong>Type coercion</strong> means that when the operands of an operator are different types, one of them will be converted to an "equivalent" value of the other operand's type. For instance, if you do:

<p>boolean == integer</p>
the boolean operand will be converted to an integer: false becomes 0, true becomes 1. Then the two values are compared.

However, if you use the non-converting comparison operator ===, no such conversion occurs. When the operands are of different types, this operator returns false, and only compares the values when they're of the same type.

        <h2>Statements and expressions</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript distinguishes expressions and statements. An expression produces a value and can be written wherever a value is expected, for example as an argument in a function call. Each of the following lines contains an expression:
    <p>myvar</p>
    <p>3 + x</p>
    <p>myfunc("a", "b")</p>
Roughly, a statement performs an action. Loops and if statements are examples of statements. A program is basically a sequence of statements (weâ€™re ignoring declarations here). Wherever JavaScript expects a statement, you can also write an expression. Such a statement is called an expression statement. The reverse does not hold: you cannot write a statement where JavaScript expects an expression. For example, an if statement cannot become the argument of a function.
